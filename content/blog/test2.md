Welcome! If you've found this text, it means you've encountered my blog before I've had a chance to produce any real content. I'm flattered you're here!

Up until now, I've never felt the need to connect with the world through a blog. But after 2+ years as the solo software developer for a biotech startup, it occurs to me that I may have learned a few things that could prove useful to other programmers trying to make the transition from academic to professional. If you come back soon, I promise I will take a crack at tackling some heavy-hitting topics such as:

- Imposter syndrome
- Self motivation
- Failing fast

As well as some less explicitly-professional thoughts I have about being a human in the modern world.

If just a single person wakes up one day feeling comforted by something they've read on this site, I'll consider this endeavor a success.
